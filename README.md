### README - Deep Learning Lab 1

#### **Overview**
In this lab, I have implemented deep learning techniques using the PyTorch library to solve both regression and multi-class classification problems. The objective was to gain hands-on experience in building Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and optimizing their performance using various techniques.

#### **Tasks & Steps**
##### **Part 1: Regression Task**
- I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand and visualize the dataset.
- I built a **Deep Neural Network (DNN) using PyTorch** to handle the regression task.
- I optimized the model using **GridSearchCV**, tuning parameters such as learning rate, optimizer type, number of epochs, and model architecture.
- I visualized **Loss vs. Epochs** and **Accuracy vs. Epochs** for both training and test data to interpret the model’s performance.
- I applied **regularization techniques** to improve the model’s generalization and compared the results with the initial model.

##### **Part 2: Multi-Class Classification Task**
- I preprocessed and cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and normalizing numerical features.
- I conducted **EDA** to analyze the dataset’s characteristics and distributions.
- I applied **data augmentation using SMOTE** to balance the dataset and address class imbalances.
- I designed and implemented a **multi-class classification DNN using PyTorch**, ensuring a well-structured architecture.
- I optimized hyperparameters using **GridSearchCV** to improve model performance.
- I plotted **Loss vs. Epochs** and **Accuracy vs. Epochs** graphs to evaluate training progress.
- I calculated evaluation metrics such as **accuracy, F1-score, and sensitivity** to measure classification performance.
- I experimented with **regularization techniques** to compare and improve the model’s effectiveness.

#### **Tools Used**
- **Google Colab/Kaggle** for running the experiments
- **PyTorch** for building and training deep learning models
- **Scikit-learn** for data preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning
- **Seaborn/Matplotlib** for visualizing data and model performance
- **SMOTE (imbalanced-learn)** for handling dataset imbalance
