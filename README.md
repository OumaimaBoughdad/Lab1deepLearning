### README - Deep Learning Lab 1

#### **Lab Overview**
This lab focuses on implementing deep learning techniques using the PyTorch library for both regression and multi-class classification tasks. The goal is to familiarize students with building Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and optimizing them for real-world datasets.

#### **Tasks & Steps**
##### **Part 1: Regression Task**
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand and visualize the dataset.
- Build a **Deep Neural Network (DNN) using PyTorch** for regression.
- Use **GridSearchCV** to optimize hyperparameters (learning rate, optimizer, model architecture, epochs).
- Visualize **Loss vs. Epochs** and **Accuracy vs. Epochs** for both training and test sets.
- Apply **regularization techniques** and compare results.

##### **Part 2: Multi-Class Classification**
- **Preprocess and clean** the dataset (handle missing values, normalize features).
- Perform **EDA** to analyze dataset characteristics.
- Apply **data augmentation (SMOTE)** to balance the dataset.
- Implement a **multi-class classification DNN using PyTorch**.
- Optimize hyperparameters using **GridSearchCV**.
- Plot **Loss vs. Epochs** and **Accuracy vs. Epochs**.
- Evaluate performance with **accuracy, F1-score, and sensitivity**.
- Apply **regularization techniques** and compare models.

#### **Tools Used**
- **Google Colab/Kaggle** for implementation
- **PyTorch** for building deep learning models
- **Scikit-learn** for preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning
- **Seaborn/Matplotlib** for data visualization
- **SMOTE (imbalanced-learn)** for handling class imbalance
- **GitHub/GitLab** for code versioning

#### **Deliverables**
- Python scripts implementing both tasks.
- Graphs and analysis reports.
- A summary of key learnings from the lab.
- Code pushed to **GitHub/GitLab** with documentation in the README.
